# Paint3DArchive
This is an archive of the releases of Microsoft Paint 3D that are directly obtained from Microsoft's servers. These files are unmodified, meaning the original digital signatures from Microsoft Corporation remained untampered.
<br><br>
All of the releases archived in this repository are in .Appxbundle format. This means that even Microsoft removes Paint3D in their servers, it will still work as it is an offline copy.

## How to install??
Here are simple steps to follow when you will install the downloaded archives Microsoft Paint 3D from this repository and installing .Appxbundle files as well.
### For Windows 10 version 1607 and higher
Just download the .appxbundle file and click to run it. Then click install if asked.

### For older versions of Windows 10
```
Add-AppxPackage -Path "C:\Path\to\File.Appx"
```
Just download the .appxbundle file and open your Powershell (not Command Prompt) then enter the following commands. Remember to replace the path with the actual path of the downloaded .appxbundle file.

## Download blocked by Browser or Security Product
Relax. Allow the download and choose to keep the file even it warns that it is dangerous. Your browser does that (specifically Microsoft Edge) because the file should be downloaded from the Microsoft Store but were downloading it from the outside.<br>
But, if the file is blocked by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and/or any security software, kindly double check the file as it is not supposed to happen as all the files here in this repository are digitally signed by Microsoft themselves.
