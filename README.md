# Paint3DArchive
This is an archive of the releases of Microsoft Paint 3D that are directly obtained from Microsoft's servers. These files are unmodified, meaning the original digital signatures from Microsoft Corporation remained untampered.
<br><br>
All of the releases archived in this repository are in .Appxbundle format. This means that even Microsoft removes Paint3D in their servers, it will still work as it is an offline copy.

## Mission
This repository is commited to deliver archival of Microsoft Paint 3D and to ensure that it will never become a lost software and to never just become a lengthy texts, images and videos of the past.
